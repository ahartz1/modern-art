## About The Art
This art was generated by using a random number generator to create the input to a function that was generated using a random formula generator. If you're interested in how this works, check out the `random_art.py` file for details.

* You will need to have **python&nbsp;3** installed on your machine or have access to a python&nbsp;3 interpreter. See [python's site](https://www.python.org/) for details.

* You will need to make sure that you have a virtual environment running in the folder that you intend to work from. [See this site for details if you're not familiar.](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)

* You will need to download and install the requirements file (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) in the folder that you intend to work from.
